The activation function is highly influential for the results.
I got poor results when using sigmoid which squeezes the  q_values between 0 and 1,
For tsetlin it might have to be high as well.
So regression tsetlin machine is probably necessary.
We might also have to be careful of how high the output range of the rtm should be, as it may affect training time.
